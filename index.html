                    <h2>Japanese Work Culture</h2>
                    <p class="sp">Japanese businesses have a collectivist approach and prioritize loyalty towards organizations as well as team unity. This collectivist culture along with their strong hierarchical system generates an atmosphere quite unlike other countries’. <br>

                        In a country renowned for its dedication and extended working hours, newcomers often face a culture shock. However, there’s been a noticeable shift over time towards shorter working hours and a better balance between personal and professional life. To navigate Japan with ease, it’s crucial to understand these cultural nuances. <br>
                        
                        While honing professional skills is essential, immersing oneself can also lead to insights into the country’s traditional work culture and customs. The Japanese working culture is characterized by long hours and immense commitment. Yet, there are emerging modern practices focused on employee well-being and career advancement opportunities.</p>
